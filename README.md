Hello, I'm a Back-end Typescript developer with an extensive background, including Full-stack development, Engineering in Test, Team leading and a bit of DevOps practice.

The list of hands-on skills includes Node.js, TypeScript, SQL and NoSQL databases, React.js and Linux.

I'm always open to code-related challenges and ready to propose non-tech improvements.
